**TWITCH COMMANDS**

For information on each command, refer to [TWITCH_COMMANDS.md](TWITCH_COMMANDS.md).
Simply paste the text located at the hyperlinks for each command into your chat in order to get them.
These commands depend on Nightbot, so make sure you have it installed correctly as well.

If this is your first time at this repo, just add [!blindtravel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sharpieman20/Sharpies-Speedrunning-Tools/main/commands/!blindtravel) and [!educatedtravel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sharpieman20/Sharpies-Speedrunning-Tools/main/commands/!educatedtravel). They are the simplest, easiest to use, and very useful.
