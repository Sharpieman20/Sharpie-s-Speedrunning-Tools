It uses the same concepts as the 8,8 rule and !onethrow to attempt to guess the stronghold from a single throw. 

**Warning**: This command is not very accurate, it might be worse than !educatedtravel on average, but it has a better chance of getting you extremely close to the stronghold.

**Rings**: Inside first ring only.


[!onethrow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sharpieman20/Sharpies-Speedrunning-Tools/main/commands/!onethrow)

Uses the 8,8 rule to try and guess the stronghold's location from a single throw.

The closer you are to the stronghold, the more likely this command is to guess correctly.

**Rings**: Any ring.
